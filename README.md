I built a Logistic Regression model that predicts whether social media usage and mental health factors affect academic performance using behavioral, sleep, and well-being features, including a custom Academic Risk Index engineered from normalized inputs.
The model was evaluated on a held-out test set, interpreted through feature coefficients and confidence scores, and prepared for deployment in an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
